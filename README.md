# Open_CV_Mini_Projects
Mini projects on Computer Vision using OPENCV helps to better understand the importance and applications of the Computer Vision field in the real world.

## Project 1: 
#### Objective: Focus on basics of CV using OPENCV
* Create a basic Meme creator with one image and a short line of text, using any openCV font.
* Detecting the QR_code and decoding the text of the QR_code.
#### Skills:
* Image reading, writing and converting from one chanel to other.
* Editing text on the top of the images in white and with black contours.
* Detecting and decoding the QR code.

## Project 2:
#### Objective: Focus on color spaces and annotations
* Tracking the green color ball out of different color balls and also identify the ball using webcam.
#### Skills:
* Working with HSV images and its hue and saturation color spectrums.
* Masking for detcting the object amoung other objects and extracting the object.

## Project 3:
#### Objective: Focus on Histograms, transformations and Bitwise operations.
* Create a method to process an image with a green screen, replace the green screen with a background image.
* Using a color image, load it with openCV then transform it to HSV and make it Grayscale (without transforming it to grayscale).
* implement at least one method (or more!) to check if a certain image corresponds to a day or a night image.
#### Skills:
* Masking, resizing, scaling, bitwise operations and ploting the range of each channels.
